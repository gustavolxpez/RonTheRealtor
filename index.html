                <h3>Where to Start</h3>
                <p>
                    As you embark on the journey of selling or buying a home, it becomes crucial to grasp the current
                    value
                    of your existing property. Various factors, including the present housing market, the neighborhood's
                    dynamics, and numerous other considerations, will play a significant role in determining the overall
                    value of your property.</p>

                <h3>Middle Ground</h3>

                <p>The main process of home buying typically begins with researching and selecting a suitable property,
                    followed by making an offer and negotiating terms with the seller. Upon mutual agreement, the buyer
                    then
                    arranges inspections, secures financing, and finally, completes the closing process to officially
                    acquire the property.</p>

                <h3>Final Process</h3>

                <p>
                    The final process of home buying involves completing the necessary paperwork, securing financing,
                    and
                    conducting a final walkthrough of the property. Once all details are verified and the closing
                    documents
                    are signed, ownership is officially transferred, marking the successful conclusion of the home
                    buying
                    journey.</p>
